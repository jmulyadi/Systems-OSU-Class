Worked on for 30 hours
The hardest thing about the lab was the design. It was hard to format and make sure all the files worked together intuitively.
THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 2.
BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL
OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE
MYSELF WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE
INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.
The readme should contain your name, the number of hours you worked on the lab, and any
comments you want to add. Of particular interest are what was hard or easy about the lab or
places where programming reinforced what we went over in class.
